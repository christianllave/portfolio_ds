# Data Science Portfolio
This portfolio contains my projects and exercises relevant to data science and analytics. 

## Projects
### [Project 1: Youtube Data API](https://github.com/christianllave/api-yt)
Used Python to extract Search data from Youtube on a specific topic, store them on SQLITE, and visualize trends from a combination of metrics.

### [Project 2: Exploring mental health incidents in New Zealand Police Data](https://github.com/christianllave/nz-police-data)
Used R to explore mental health reports over time (May 2020 - Mar 2023), incident report accuracy, incident report subgroups, report occurrences over time by urban context (city vs non-city), and volume of incidents by urban context. This is followed by insights and potential recommendations.

## Exercises 
### Exercise 1: Project Euler #1 (3 or 5)
Used Python (Method 1) and R (Method 2) for loops to count from 0 to a given number, identifying whether that number is a multiple of 3 or 5, storing them in a list, and then taking the sum of the numbers.

### Exercise 2: Project Euler #5 (Smallest Multiple)
Used Python to take a range from two inputs (start, end) to output the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from the given range.
