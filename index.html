                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Increased profit margins by limiting ad requests to profitable observations.</div>
                            <p>Supply-Side Platforms manage ad space by deciding which instances of web traffic would be good to show ads to;
                                however, not all traffic is profitable, and sending these instances to the auction (real-time bidding) can be costly.
                                The nature of the data and potential target variables were akin to the marketing funnel that had preceding steps that informed the latter.
                                This project aimed to drop unprofitable traffic to save on costs, while retaining as much revenue as possible.
                                As a solution in the digital ad industry, it must deliver the predictions in a fraction of a second.
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>Given the nature of the data being mostly categorical, the solution made use of categorical features.
                                I explored three ensemble frameworks commonly used for the said data type. Given the funnel-like nature of the data, 
                                I created three different architectures:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Simple:</b> directly predict each candidate target variable using identified features. This was simple and effective.</li>
                                    <li><b>Narrowing:</b> have target variables learn only based on observations present in the preceding step.</li>
                                    <li><b>Cascading:</b> predict succeeding target variables using outputs from previous steps of the funnel as features. This mimicked the real-time bidding behaviour most closely.</li>
                                </ul>

                                The delivered solution made use of a simple machine learning architecture to predict revenue.
                                The result satisfied the company's data needs while having 20% less opportunity costs than the previous model.</p>

                            <p>
                                Additionally, this project had also undergone the production process by creating the accompanying assets: threshold seeker, hyperparameter tuning, modules, tests, a docker image, Airflow DAG and deploying as a cloud service. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Management makes use of spend, revenue, and eCommerce metrics to make marketing decisions.
                                The stakeholders had a preference for tables that could be explored by date range and broken down by date.
                                Another consideration for this project is the fact that the tool will be used by non-technical stakeholders.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>The way to accomplish the data needs was by integrating brand assets: Facebook, Instagram, Shopify, Google Ads, and Google Analytics into an interactive reporting tool.
                                With non-technical stakeholders in mind, I have set my own limitations on top of meeting the data needs:
                                <ul>
                                    <li class="mb-2">I should not require them to code or install Python for them to use the tool.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-2">The data should be formatted in a way they recognise: tabular like Excel.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-2">Ensure fool-proof API access and security.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                            
                            <p>Google assets had native integrations to the selected reporting tool.
                                For the other channels, I used their respective APIs to extract, transform, and store information on a cloud asset.
                                I then integrated all the data on the reporting tool, created calculated fields that combined metrics from different sources,
                                and created the necessary visualisations.
                            </p>

                            <p class="mb-1 text-secondary"><b>Main takeaways:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li class="mb-2">One of the challenges at the time was dealing with APIs, which required a lot of reading up on documentation.
                                        One of my main takeaways was to make my code style match the demands of each API's documentation.
                                        This allowed me to follow the logic and ensure convenient points to edit my code should there be any changes in the documentation.
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="mb-2">Dealing with JSON objects meant I had to transform column values that were non-singular, such as lists and dictionaries.
                                        Working on this project allowed me to develop ways to convert non-relational formats to relational in a vectorised fashion.
                                        Using vectorised functions allowed for more efficiency as opposed to methods that iterate over observations.
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="mb-2">Having the end-user in mind allows for a clear picture of limitations in terms of user exprience and infrastructure.</li>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Explore trends in mental health report misclassifications to the police as indicators of supplementary social services.</div>
                            <p>In 2021, the New Zealand Police expressed a need to approach call-outs related to mental health issues.
                                To free up the workload of the police force in that regard, it would be good to explore existing trends on mental health-related issues.
                            <p>Using the NZ Police's Demand and Activity as the main data source,
                                I used R to group and visualise police reports related to mental health based on the activity's classifications, time, and date.</p>
                                
                            <p>This allowed trends of mental health reports to surface, showing which aspects of social services could be focused on to provide better mental health support.

                            <p>For my first Python project, I wanted to understand popular video topics in a certain niche, and explore Youtube as a data source.
                                One of the largest limitations to the project is the rate limit, which compelled me to consider an ETL process to avoid redundant extraction.
                            </p>
                            <p>I used Python to extract data, Pandas to perform transformations, and SQLITE to store the results. 
                                In its first iteration, the project allowed for visualisations and inspections of overarching trends of videos and the connectedness of channels.
                                In future iterations, I aim to apply machine learning techniques as a form of feature engineering or predictive analytics.</p>
                            <p>I intend to use this project as a foundational data source for me to explore other data projects and techniques.</p>
